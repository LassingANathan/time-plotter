## time-plotter
# PROOF OF CONCEPT.
Python TimeTracker application that can graph time spent on a user's inputted activities. Utilizes MySQL for data storage and MatPlotLib for graphing.
This application connects to a MySQL database hosted for free on HelioHost. While this application does have a user system, it is primarily a proof of concept, and does not utilize paswords. As such, users should assume that all entered information is freely visible and is liable to be deleted at any point.
If one wants to use this application, it would be advisable for them to download this project and connect to  their own MySQL database by changing the relevent fields in the sqlConnector.py file (JSON configuration coming soon)
